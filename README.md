Image Captioning and Classification with BLIP and CLIP 
Image Captioning and Classification with BLIP and CLIP
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive solution for image captioning and content classification. It integrates state-of-the-art models to generate captions for images, classify them into predefined categories, and incorporates an external API for additional classification. The final prediction is determined through an ensemble approach.

Features
Image Captioning: Uses the BLIP model to generate descriptive captions for images.
Zero-Shot Classification: Utilizes the CLIP model to classify images into predefined categories without requiring training data for those categories.
Ensemble Prediction: Combines predictions from the BLIP model, CLIP model, and an external API to provide a final classification based on voting.
External API Integration: Placeholder function for integrating external APIs for additional image content moderation.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the script.
Transformers Library: Includes BLIP and CLIP models for image processing and classification.
Pillow (PIL): For image handling and manipulation.
Requests: For downloading images from URLs.
Torch: For model inference.
